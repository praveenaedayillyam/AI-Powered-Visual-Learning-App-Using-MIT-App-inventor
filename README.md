# 🎨 AI-Powered-Visual-Learning-App-Using-MIT-App-inventer

**Visual Learning Quiz App** is an interactive **AI-powered educational mobile application** developed using **MIT App Inventor**.  
The app is specially designed to help **small kids** learn and identify everyday objects in a **fun, visual, and engaging way**.

---

## 📱 App Overview

The app asks children to **show a real-world object** (like a flower or pen) to the mobile camera.  
An **AI model** predicts the object, and the app gives instant feedback — making learning playful and exciting.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- 📷 **Camera-based object recognition**
- 🤖 **AI model trained using Teachable Machine**
- 🎯 Random object selection for every round
- 🎉 Instant feedback (Right / Wrong)
- 🔁 Play Again option for repeated learning
- 🧒 Designed especially for **small kids & beginners**

---

## 🧩 Objects Used for Learning

The AI model is trained to recognize the following objects:

- 🌸 Flower  
- 📘 Book  
- 🖊️ Pen  
- 🖱️ Mouse  
- 🍶 Bottle  

---

## 🖥️ App Screens & Workflow

### 🔹 Screen 1 – Quiz Screen
- The app randomly selects **one object** from the list.
- The child is asked to **show that object** to the camera.
- Click **Check** button to predict.

**Logic:**
- If `Predicted Object == Asked Object` → Go to **Screen 2**
- Else → Go to **Screen 3**

---

### 🔹 Screen 2 – Correct Answer Screen 🎉
- Displays **“Congratulations! Right Answer”**
- Includes a **Play Again** button
- Play Again → Returns to **Screen 1**

---

### 🔹 Screen 3 – Wrong Answer Screen ❌
- Displays **“Wrong Answer”**
- Includes a **Play Again** button
- Play Again → Returns to **Screen 1**

---

## 🤖 AI Model Details

- Model trained using **Google Teachable Machine**
- Custom image dataset created for all listed objects
- Model exported and hosted online
- Prediction is done using the **Teachable Machine model link** integrated into MIT App Inventor

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **MIT App Inventor**
- **Google Teachable Machine**
- **Image Classification Model**
- **Mobile Camera Integration**

---

## 🎯 Target Users

- 👶 Small kids  
- 🏫 Early learners  
- 📚 Beginners in visual learning  
- 👨‍🏫 Teachers and trainers for demo purposes  

This app helps kids **learn by seeing, showing, and playing**, instead of memorizing.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Add more objects (fruits, animals, colors)
